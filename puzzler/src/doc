a grid should be 11x5 big by default
a grid can be initialised with any width/height
a gridpoint should have value '0'/EMPTY by default
a grid should have any gridpoint accessible by coordinate
a grid can be initialised with a string containing lines of characters
a piece should be placeable on a grid
a piece should be placeable on a grid if all non-empty places of the piece are empty on the grid
a piece should be placeable on a grid in any rotation
a piece should be placeable on a grid flipped
a grid should be able to give a list of all positions and orientations a piece could fit
a grid should be able to remove a piece
a grid should be able to return the list of possible positions sorted on best fit
	best fit is (to start with) most sides connecting 
	with non-empty fields

a grid should be able to give a solution with a set of given pieces 
a grid should be able to indicate solution is not possible for a set of given pieces
a grid should be able to give all possible solutions for a set of given pieces
a grid should be able to give all moves that can result in a solution for 
	a given grid situation an set over pieces
a grid should be able to sort possible moves to exclude moves that would result
in a single open space (hmmm... unless there's a fitting piece for that. Not in default pieces)
